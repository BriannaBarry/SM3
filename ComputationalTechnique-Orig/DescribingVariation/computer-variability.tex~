To illustrate computer techniques for describing variability, I will
use the data that Galton collected on the heights of adult children
and their parents.\cite{hanley-2004} These are in a modern,
case/variable format in the file
\texttt{galton.csv}. \datasetGalton

\begin{verbatim}
> galton = read.csv("galton.csv")
\end{verbatim}


\sectionone{Simple Statistical Calculations}

Simple numerical descriptions are easy to compute.  Here are the mean,
median, standard deviation and variance of the children's heights (in
inches).
\begin{verbatim}
> mean( galton$height )
[1] 66.76069
> median( galton$height )
[1] 66.5
> sd( galton$height )
[1] 3.582918
> var( galton$height )
[1] 12.83730
\end{verbatim}
Notice that the variance (\code{var})
is just the square of the standard deviation (\code{sd}); having both
operators is just a convenience.

Computing percentiles is done with the \code{quantile} operator.  The
first argument is the data on which you want to compute the
percentile, the second specifies which percentiles you want.  The
\code{quantile} operator is arranged so that the percentile is given
as a decimal, so use 0.50 to indicate that you want the 50-th
percentile.  Examples:  

\begin{itemize}
\item The 25th percentile:
\begin{verbatim}
> quantile( galton$height, 0.25 )
25% 
 64 
\end{verbatim}

\item The 25th and 75th percentile in a single command --- in other
  words, the 50 percent coverage interval:
\begin{verbatim}
> quantile( galton$height, c(0.25, 0.75) )
 25%  75% 
64.0 69.7 
\end{verbatim}

\item The 2.5th and 97.5th percentile --- in other words, the 95
  percent coverage interval:
\begin{verbatim}
> quantile( galton$height, c(0.025, 0.975) )
 2.5% 97.5% 
   60    73 
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

The interquartile range is the width of the 50 percent coverage
interval:
\begin{verbatim}
> IQR(galton$height)
[1] 5.7
\end{verbatim}

Some other useful operators are \code{min}, \code{max}, and
\code{range}.  

For convenience, the \code{summary} operator gives a quick description
of a quantitative variable:
\begin{verbatim}
> summary(galton$height)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  56.00   64.00   66.50   66.76   69.70   79.00 
\end{verbatim}



In exercises in later chapters, you will need to compute the sum of
squares of quantitative variables and of residuals.  This is done by
connecting simple computations: squaring then summing.
\begin{verbatim}
> sum( galton$height^2 )
[1] 4013892
\end{verbatim}

In all of these examples, the operator has been applied directly to a
variable in a data frame.  Of course, any of these operators can be applied to
any vector.  For example, here is the standard deviation of the
numbers $1, 2, 3, \cdots, 100$:
\begin{verbatim}
> mean( seq(1,100))
[1] 50.5
\end{verbatim}

\sectionone{Residuals and Sums of Squares}


The residual from the mean can be computed like this:
\begin{verbatim}
> resids = galton$height - mean(galton$height)
\end{verbatim}
Remember that each case has its own residual.  There are 898 cases in
the Galton data, so there are 898 residuals.
\begin{verbatim}
> resids
[1]     6.43931   2.43931   2.23931   2.23931
[5]     6.73931   5.73931  -1.26069  -1.26069
        ... and so on ...
[893]   1.93931   1.73931   0.93931  -2.76069
[897]  -3.26069  -3.76069
\end{verbatim}
The sum of squares is 
\begin{verbatim}
> sum(resids^2)
[1] 11515
\end{verbatim}

\sectionone{Simple Statistical Graphics}

There are several basic types of statistical graphics to display
the distribution of a variable: histograms, density plots, and
boxplots.  These are easily mastered by example.

parameter settings in the start-up file.]]]]]]

\sectiontwo{Histograms}

Constructing a histogram involves dividing the range of a variable up
into bins and counting how many cases fall into each bin.  This is
done in an almost entirely automatic way:
\begin{verbatim}
> histogram( galton$height )
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{hist1.pdf}

When constructing a histogram, R makes an automatic but sensible
choice of the number of bins.  If you like, you can control this
yourself.  For instance:
\begin{verbatim}
> histogram( galton$height, breaks=25 )
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{hist2.pdf}

The  horizontal axis of the histogram is always in the units of the variable.
For the histograms above, the  horizontal axis is in ``inches'' because that
is the unit of the \verb+galton$height+ variable.  

The vertical axis is conventionally drawn in one of three ways:
controlled by an optional argument named \code{type}.
\begin{description}
\item[Absolute Frequency or Counts]  A simple count of the number of cases that
  falls into each bin.  This mode is set by setting
  \code{type="count"} as in \verb+histogram(galton$height, type="count")+.
\item[Relative Frequency] The vertical axis is scaled so that the 
height of the bar give the proportion of cases that fall into the
bin.  This is the default.
\item[Density] The vertical axis 
{\em area} of the bar gives the relative proportion of cases that fall
into the bin.  Set \code{type="density"} as in \verb+histogram(galton$height,type="density")+ .
\end{description}
In a density plot, areas can be interpreted as probabilities and the
area under the entire histogram is equal to 1.

Other useful optional arguments set the labels for the axes and the
graph as a whole and color the bars.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
> histogram(galton$height, type="density",
    xlab="Height (inches)", 
    main="Distribution of Heights",
    col="blue")
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{hist3.pdf}

The above command is so long that it has been broken into several
lines for display purposes.  R ignores the line breaks, holding off on
executing the command until it sees the final closing parentheses.
Notice the use of quotation marks to delimit the labels and names like
\code{"blue"}.

\sectiontwo{Density Plots}

A \newword{density plot} avoids the need to create bins and plots out
the distribution as a continuous curve.  Making a density plot
involves two operators.  The \newword{density} operator performs the
basic computation which is then displayed using either the \code{plot}
or the \code{lines} operator.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
> densityplot( galton$height ) 
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{density1.pdf}

If you want to suppress the rug-like plotting of points at the bottom
of the graph, use \verb+densityplot(galton$height,plot.points=FALSE)+.

\sectiontwo{Box-and-Whisker Plots}

\begin{comment}
# Setting parameters for box plots]
foo = trellis.par.get("box.umbrella")
foo$lwd=3
foo$lty=1
foo$col='black'
foo = trellis.par.set("box.umbrella",foo)
foo = trellis.par.get("box.rectangle")
foo$lwd=3
foo$col='black'
foo = trellis.par.set("box.rectangle",foo)
# for axis text, etc.
foo = trellis.par.get("axis.text")
foo$cex=1.2
foo = trellis.par.set("axis.text",foo)
foo = trellis.par.get("par.xlab.text")
foo$cex=1.2
foo$col='black'
foo = trellis.par.set("par.xlab.text",foo)
foo = trellis.par.set("par.ylab.text",foo)
\end{comment}

Box-and-whisker plots are made with the \code{bwplot} command:
\begin{verbatim}
> bwplot( galton$height )
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{box1.pdf}

The median is represented by the heavy dot in the middle.  Outliers,
if any, are marked by dots outside the whiskers.


The real power of the box-and-whisker plot is for comparing
distributions.  This will be raised again more systematically in later
chapters, but just to illustrate, here is how to compare the heights
of males and females:
\begin{verbatim}
> bwplot( height ~ sex, data=galton )
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{box2.pdf}

\sectionone{Displays of Categorical Variables}

For categorical variables, it makes no sense to compute descriptive
statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, or variance.
Instead, look at the number of cases at each level of the variable.
\begin{verbatim}
> table( galton$sex )
  F   M 
433 465 
\end{verbatim}
By processing such a table with the \code{prop.table} operator, you
can calculate the proportion of cases at each level.
\begin{verbatim}
> prop.table( table( galton$sex ))
     F      M 
0.4822 0.5178 
\end{verbatim}

The \code{barchart} operator will produce graphics from such tables.
\begin{verbatim}
> barchart( table(galton$sex) )
\end{verbatim}
\noindent \graphicsfile[width=2.5in]{bar1.pdf}
