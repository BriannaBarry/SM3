# Outline {-}



# To build this book {-}

This `index.Rmd` will always contain the first part of the book.

For a Tufte book in HTML, give the following command in the shell:
```
sh _build.sh
```

To get the navigation as a bar, somehow contrive to put these two
lines just before the table of contents in the HTML file:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="toc.css" type="text/css" />
```

For a PDF file, change `_build.sh` or just run the following command:
```
Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', bookdown::tufte_book2())"
```

To avoid chapter numbering, put `{-}` after the level-one heading.



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
