Create a spreadsheet with the three variables \VN{distance}, \VN{team}, and \VN{position}, in the following way:

\medskip

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{rll}
\VN{distance} & \VN{team} & \VN{position}\\\hline
5 & Eagles & center\\
12 & Eagles & forward\\
11 & Eagles & end\\
2 & Doves & center\\
18 & Doves & end\\
12 & Penguins & forward\\
15 & Penguins & end\\
19 & Eagles & back\\
5 & Penguins & center\\
12 & Penguins & back\\
\end{tabular}}

\medskip

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item After entering the data, you can calculate the mean \VN{distance} in various ways.
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the grand mean distance?\\
\SelectSetHoriz{11.1}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\item What is the group mean distance for the three teams?
\begin{itemize}
\item Eagles \SelectSetHoriz{11.75}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\item Doves \SelectSetHoriz{10}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\item Penguins \SelectSetHoriz{11}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\end{itemize}
\item What is the group mean distance for the following positions?
\begin{itemize}
\item back \SelectSetHoriz{15.5}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\item center \SelectSetHoriz{4}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\item end \SelectSetHoriz{14.67}{4,9.25,10,11,11.1,11.75,12,14.67,15.5}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Now, just for the sake of developing an understanding of group means, you are going to change the \VN{dist} data.  Make up values for \VN{dist} so that the mean \VN{dist} for Eagles is 14, for Penguins is 13, and for Doves is 15.

Cut and paste the output from R showing the means for these groups and then the means taken group-wise according to \VN{position}.  \TextEntry

\item Now arrange things so that the means are as stated in (b) but {\bf every} case has a residual of either $1$ or $-1$.

\end{enumerate}
