Read in the Galton height data
\begin{verbatim}
> g = fetchData("galton.csv")
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the standard deviation of the height?
\item Calculate the grand mean and, from that, the residuals of the
  actual heights from the grand mean.
\begin{verbatim}
> mean(height, data=g)
[1] 66.76069
> res0 = g$height - 66.76069
> sd(res0)
\end{verbatim}
What is the standard deviation of the residuals from this "grand mean"
model? \SelectSetHoriz{3.58}{2.51,2.58,2.92,3.58,3.82}
\item Calculate the group-wise mean for the different sexes and, from
  that, the residuals of the actual heights from this group-wise
  model.
\begin{verbatim}
> mod1 = mean( height ~ sex, data=g)
> res1 = g$height - fitted( mod1, data=g)
> sd(res1)
\end{verbatim}
What is the standard deviation of the residuals from this group-wise
model? 
\SelectSetHoriz{2.51}{2.51,2.58,2.92,3.58,3.82}
\item Explain why the standard deviation of the residuals of the
  group-wise model less than the standard deviation of the residuals
  of the ``grand mean'' model. \TextEntry
