In Galton's data, are the sons typically taller than their fathers? 
Create a variable that is
the difference between the son's height and the father's height.
(Arrange it so that a positive number refers to a son who is taller
than his father.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item What's the mean height difference (in inches)?\\
\SelectSetHoriz{0.06}{-2.47,-0.31,0.06,66.76,69.23}

\item What's the standard deviation (in inches)?\\
\SelectSetHoriz{2.74}{1.32,2.63,2.74,3.58,3.75}

\item What is the 95-percent coverage interval (in inches)?
\begin{MultipleChoice}
\wrong{-3.7 to 4.8}
\wrong{-4.6 to 4.9}
\correct{-5.2 to 5.6}
\wrong{-9.5 to 4.5}
\end{MultipleChoice}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{AnswerText}
First, you need to pull out the data for males.
\begin{verbatim}
> males = subset( galton, sex=='M')
> mean(males$height - males$father)
[1] 0.06065
> sd(males$height - males$father)
[1] 2.735
> quantile(males$height - males$father, c(.025,.975))
 2.5% 97.5% 
-5.18  5.58 
\end{verbatim}
\end{AnswerText}
