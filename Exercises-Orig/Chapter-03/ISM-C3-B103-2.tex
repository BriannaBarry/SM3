The plot shows two different displays of density.  The displays might
be from the same distribution or two different distributions.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What are the two displays?

\begin{MultipleChoice}
\wrong{Density and cumulative}
\correct{Rug and cumulative}
\wrong{Cumulative and box plot}
\wrong{Density and rug plot}
\wrong{Rug and box plot}
\end{MultipleChoice}

\begin{AnswerText}
The rug plot is the small ticks on the horizontal axis.  The other
distribution has a shape that increases steadily --- never decreasing --- starting from 0 on
the left and going to 1 on the right.  That's the shape of a
cumulative distribution.  
\end{AnswerText}

\item 
The two displays show the same distribution. \TorF{true} 


\item Describe briefly any sign of mismatch or what features convince you
that the two displays are equivalent. \\
