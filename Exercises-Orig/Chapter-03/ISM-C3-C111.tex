%% Subject: Descriptive statistics and distribution shapes

If two distributions have the same five-number summary, must their
density plots have the same shape?  Explain.\TextEntry

\begin{AnswerText}
The answer is no.  The five-number summary describes a lot about
the distribution, but not everything.  To see why this is, think about
the cumulative distribution.  When two distributions have the same
five-number summary, their respective cumulative distributions must
take on the same values at the 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00
quantiles, but in between these points, the cumulative can be different.
