The following statement gives a result that some people are surprised by
\begin{verbatim}
> 10e3 == 1000
[1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}
Explain why the result was FALSE rather than TRUE.

\begin{MultipleChoice}
\wrong{10e3 is 100, not 1000}
\correct{10e3 is 10000, not 1000}
\wrong{10e3 is not a valid number}
\wrong{It should be true; there's a bug in the software.}
\end{MultipleChoice}

\begin{AnswerText}
The computer returns \texttt{FALSE} because the quantities being
compared with \texttt{==} are not equal. \texttt{10e3} is ten-thousand
in scientific notation.  It's \texttt{1e3} that is one-thousand.
\end{AnswerText}
