\begin{AnswerText}
The command specifies {\bf both} of the arguments \texttt{by} and
\texttt{length}.  These arguments are inconsistent with one another:
they would result in different sequences.
The person who wrote the \texttt{seq} software was polite enough to
warn you of such situations so that you can fix them.
