%% Subject: Numbers on the computer

Since the computer has to represent numbers that are both very large
and very small, scientific notation is often used.  The number
\texttt{7.23e4} means $7.23\times 10^4 = 72300$.  The number
\texttt{1.37e-2} means $1.37\times 10^{-2} = 0.0137$.

For each of the following numbers written in computer scientific
notation, say what is the corresponding number.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \texttt{3e1} \SelectSetHoriz{30}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\item \texttt{1e3}
  \SelectSetHoriz{100}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\item \texttt{0.1e3}
  \SelectSetHoriz{10}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\item \texttt{0.3e-2}
  \SelectSetHoriz{0.003}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\item \texttt{10e3}
  \SelectSetHoriz{10000}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\item \texttt{10e-3}
  \SelectSetHoriz{0.01}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\item \texttt{0.0003e3}
  \SelectSetHoriz{0.3}{.0001,0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30,100,300,1000,3000,10000}
\end{enumerate}
